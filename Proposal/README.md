# Closet App

Outline of the Proposed Application

The Flutter Closet App is designed to simplify the process of organizing, managing, and caring for your wardrobe digitally. The main functionalities include:

Clothing Digitization: Users can capture images of their clothing items and categorize them within the app based on type (e.g., shirts, pants, dresses) and other relevant attributes.

Outfit Creation: Users can mix and match clothing items from their digital closet to create stylish outfits. These outfits can be saved and organized into personalized catalogs within the app.

Laundry Instructions and Clothing Care: The app utilizes image recognition technology to interpret laundry symbols from clothing tags. It then provides users with laundry instructions and suggestions for proper care based on these symbols.
